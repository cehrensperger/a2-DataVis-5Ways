# Python + Altair

Python is a popular language for data anaylsis and visualization. It is useful for quick prototyping and readable code.</br>
Altair is a very popular data visualization library for Python.</br></br>

To visualize the Penglings dataset, the Chart(url) function. From here I was able to add a chain of function calls including </br>
.mark_circle() to specify that I want my makers for the scatter plot to be circles.</br>
.encode( parameters ) to specify parameters like, what data to use for the x and y axes, what data to use to control the size marker, and more.</br>
.interactive() to make the the plot click-and-draggable as well as give it the ability to zoom in and out</br>
.transform_filter() to interface with the linked count of records vs year graph.</br>
and more</br></br>

Technical Achievements: </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ability to control the years that are included the scatter plot throught the linked count of records vs year graph</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ability to filter the results by species using the radio buttons in combination with the above</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ability to click and drag and zoom in and out of the scatter plot</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tooltip functionality

Design Achievements: </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -I think the choice to control the scatter plot, with the linked count of records vs year graph is intuitive and useful for the viewer/user. While this data set did not have much granular data over time (all of the data points only had year information over only 3 years), I think for a different data set this linked control could be even more useful/intuitive</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Legends</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Consistent color scheme (throughout all graphs in this project)
